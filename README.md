# CM Storm QuickFire TK Karabiner Config For Mac
In order to take advantage of all of the functionality of the CM Storm QuickFire TK on Mac, you'll need to download and install [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) (free) and drop in a custom private.xml file to correctly map `NUMLK` since it's not a Mac standard.

You'll want to keep any mappings specific to your TK inside of the Quickfire TK `item` or else they'll interfere with other input devices (eg. MacBook keyboard).
