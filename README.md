# CM Storm QuickFire Rapid & TK Karabiner Config For Mac
In order to take advantage of all of the functionality of the CM Storm QuickFire TK on Mac, you'll need to download and install [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) (free) and drop in a custom private.xml file.

You'll want to keep any mappings specific to your TK inside of the specific `item` tags or else they'll interfere with other input devices (eg. MacBook keyboard).

The **QuickFire Rapid** config includes media key assignments and `command`/`option` key swaps to behave more like a Mac. The **QuickFire TK** config enables correct `NUMLK` functionality, as well as the `command`/`option` key swaps.  I didn't have any issues with the TK media keys out of the box, but the Rapid media key mappings should be interchangeable.
